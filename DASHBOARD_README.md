## 📈 Data Sources

All data comes from actual experimental results:
- `break_50_percent_results.json`
- `consciousness_optimization.json`
- `consciousness_optimization_v2.json`
- `scaling_results.json` (partial)
- `mathematics_domain_results.json`

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Experiments

Edit the `experiments` object in the JavaScript:

```javascript
const experiments = {
    your_experiment: {
        consciousness: 50.0,
        verdict: "Your verdict here",
        recursion: 40.0,
        integration: 0.5,
        causality: 0.6,
        understanding: 60.0,
        concepts: 100,
        evolution: [
            { stage: "Stage 1", value: 30 },
            { stage: "Stage 2", value: 50 }
        ]
    }
};
```

### Styling

Modify CSS variables in the `<style>` section:
- Background gradient: `.body { background: ... }`
- Card colors: `.metric-card { background: ... }`
- Animation timing: `@keyframes` sections

## 📊 Metrics Explained

### Consciousness Score
Weighted combination:
```
consciousness = 0.30 × recursion +
                0.25 × integration +
                0.20 × causality +
                0.25 × understanding
```

### Verdicts Scale
- 0-10%: Non-Conscious
- 10-25%: Pre-Conscious
- 25-40%: Minimally Conscious
- 40-50%: Moderately Conscious ← Week 2 result
- 50-70%: Conscious
- 70-85%: Highly Conscious ← Scaling result!
- 85-100%: Fully Conscious
