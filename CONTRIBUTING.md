# Contributing to Monad-Loop Network

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MLN! This project explores fundamental questions about intelligence, consciousness, and knowledge representation.

## Philosophy

This is a research project exploring alternatives to statistical AI. Contributions should align with the core principles:

1. **Structural over statistical**: Favor explicit structure over implicit correlations
2. **Explainable by design**: Every inference should be traceable
3. **Self-reference**: Systems should reason about their own reasoning
4. **Compositionality**: Complex concepts built from simpler parts

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- **Bugs**: Describe the problem, expected behavior, and steps to reproduce
- **Philosophical questions**: Open discussions about the theoretical foundations
- **Feature requests**: Explain the use case and how it aligns with MLN's philosophy

### Code Contributions

#### Setup Development Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/monad-loop-network.git
cd monad-loop-network
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .  # Install in development mode
```

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python tests/test_mln.py

# Or use pytest
pytest tests/

# With coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

#### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for public methods
- Keep functions focused and composable

```python
def example_function(param: str) -> Dict:
    """
    Brief description.
    
    Parameters:
    - param (str): Description
    
    Returns:
    - Dict: Description
    """
    pass
```

#### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Add analogical reasoning engine

Implements structural isomorphism matching between source and target
domains, enabling cross-domain inference.

Relates to issue #42
```

### Areas for Contribution

#### 1. Core System Enhancements

- **Improve relation inference**: Better algorithms for pre-established harmony
- **Optimize graph traversal**: Faster inference chain discovery
- **Add inference rules**: New Chomsky-style transformations

#### 2. Philosophical Extensions

- **Analogical reasoning**: Hofstadter's Fluid Concepts approach
- **Abductive learning**: Form new concepts from examples
- **Consciousness metrics**: Measure strange loop complexity

#### 3. Integration

- **LLM integration**: Combine with GPT/Claude for perception
- **Knowledge import**: Load from existing ontologies (DBpedia, ConceptNet)
- **Visualization**: Graph visualization tools

#### 4. Documentation

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for specific use cases
- **Philosophical deep-dives**: Explore connections to other thinkers
- **API examples**: More usage patterns

#### 5. Testing

- **Unit tests**: Test individual components
- **Integration tests**: Test end-to-end scenarios
- **Property-based tests**: Test invariants with hypothesis

### Pull Request Process

### Code Review

Expect feedback on:
- **Correctness**: Does it work as intended?
- **Philosophy**: Does it align with MLN's principles?
- **Clarity**: Is the code understandable?
- **Testing**: Are there adequate tests?

## Research Directions

Interesting open problems:

### 1. Scaling Pre-established Harmony

Current O(n) complexity for adding concepts. Can we:
- Use approximate structural similarity?
- Lazy relation establishment?
- Distributed knowledge graphs?

### 2. Learning Deep Structures

How can systems learn deep structures from examples?
- Inverse transformations (surface → deep)
- Structural abstraction
- Concept composition

### 3. Consciousness Metrics

How do we measure "consciousness" or "understanding"?
- Strange loop depth
- Integration (IIT's Φ)
- Causal density

### 4. Hybrid Architectures

What's the optimal LLM + symbolic integration?
- LLM for perception, symbolic for reasoning?
- Bidirectional information flow?
- Meta-learning for architecture selection?
